## What is the project about and why do we collect personal data?
This is a qualitative design study with the aim of understanding how individuals perceive 
academic conferences. This includes, but is not limited to, how individuals make decisions 
to attend specific conferences; how conferences are compared/contrasted; how the experience 
of attending conferences differs for underrepresented groups. We seek to achieve these aims 
by (1) collecting responses to the questions in this survey, (2) inviting survey participants 
to an optional follow-up interview, and (3) collecting publicly available data (e.g., on 
conference websites).

Your participation in this survey will consist of spending around 15 minutes answering questions 
regarding conferences in general, specific conferences, and your demographic characteristics. 
At the end of this survey, you will be asked to indicate whether you are interested in 
participating in a follow-up interview. The follow-up interview is optional and will consist 
of a 30- to 60-minute interview involving reflection on your experiences attending conferences. 
The interview will be conducted by Bethany Chamberlain and take place in Copenhagen, Denmark 
or on Zoom/Teams.

Your participation is voluntary, and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time, 
without the need to provide a reason, by contacting Bethany Chamberlain at 
[bcha@itu.dk](mailto:bcha@itu.dk). Doing so will have no adverse effects.

This project is conducted by the IT University of Copenhagen (CVR no. 29057753) and is 
supported by Novo Nordisk Foundation starting package grant NNF21OC0068816.

## Participation Incentive
To thank you for your time, interested participants will be entered into a raffle. After the 
survey is closed, 5 raffle winners will be randomly selected. Gifts for the raffle winners 
will be chosen after the winners are contacted to account for international participation. 
Gifts can be expected to include options such as: movie tickets, a coffee clip card, chocolates, 
wine, or a combination thereof. The total value of the gift will be around 200 DKK (25 EUR / 25 USD). 
Please note that, for tax purposes, we are unable to offer cash or cash gift certificates.

For the first 50 participants from the IT University of Copenhagen, you can also get a ticket 
for a scoop of ice cream from Ismageriet to thank you for completing the survey.

## What personal data does the project process?
For all questions relating to personal, identifying data, you will have the option not to 
respond. You will also be provided with space to self-describe (i.e., as opposed to a 
checkbox) whenever relevant. The project will process the following information about you:
* Preferred name
* Preferred pronouns
* Email (personal or professional)
* Affiliation(s)
* Occupation
* Age
* Gender identity
* Group(s) identity (e.g., LGBTQIA+, ethnic minority, disability status)
* Relationship to conferences (e.g., attendee, speaker, etc)
* Opinions on specific conferences

## Planned Output
The data collected during this project will contribute to the PhD theses of Bethany 
Chamberlain and Dovile Juodelyte in the form of either (1) a joint publication or 
(2) two separate publications. This may be subject to change within reason. Any such 
publications will use anonymized and aggregated data from this project.

## Data Storage
Anonymized data will be stored on SurveyXact by Rambøll, password protected work laptop(s) 
secured by ITU, and/or OneDrive. Anonymized data will be stored for a maximum period of 
5 years to allow time for analysis, thesis writing, and publication purposes. After which, 
only anonymized data integral to the peer review process and the general understanding of the 
results will be preserved.

Personal, identifying data will be replaced with key codes during the process of anonymization 
by Bethany Chamberlain (e.g., name, email). Personal, identifying data linked with key codes 
will be kept in paper form and locked in an office at the IT University of Copenhagen for a 
maximum of 1 year. After which it will be shredded and disposed of responsibly. Personal, 
identifying data will be deleted from SurveyXact immediately after the anonymization process.
