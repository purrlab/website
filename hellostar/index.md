# HelloStar Conference Similarity Project

The HelloStar project aims to understand how researchers make decisions about attending
conferences, how they compare and contrast conferences, and how participants belonging to
underrepresented groups have different experiences/perceptions.

How does a person just starting their academic career, or a person who is switching to 
a different field, choose their community, such as which conferences they want to 
attend? Our intuition is that depends on the networks and opportunities available to 
the researcher, and might disadvantage people from underrepresented groups who may 
already receive less mentorship. We propose to study conference similarity, which would 
allow individuals from some group to discover conferences that might be a good fit for 
them not just in terms of research, but also values such as the inclusivity of the 
conference. In this abstract we outline our work-in-progress and intended future steps, 
and open the discussion with other researchers interested in this and related questions.
